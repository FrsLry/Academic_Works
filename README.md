## MEDO: Methods for the Exploitation of Data in Oceanography (Villefranche-sur-Mer, France)

[This poster](https://github.com/FrsLry/Univeristy_Works/blob/master/MEDO_poster_LEROY.pdf) show data analysis (R and Ocean Data View) made after several sampling cruises. The objective here was to study inshore-offshore biotic and abiotic gradients in the Villefranche Bay. We had less than a week to present our results. 

The analysis are: 

* Temperature-Salinity diagram
* PCA (Principal Component Analysis) 
* The first dimension represents mostly abiotic properties of the water masses
* The second dimension represents the nutrients
* Coordinates (Dim 1 and Dim 2) of each point are then extracted and represented against the distance to the coast
* Linear interpolation of the chlorphyll a shows the Deep Chlorophyll Maximum (around 50m depth)
* The clustering shows the inshore-offshore differentiation of the different stations
